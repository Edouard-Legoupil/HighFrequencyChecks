\arguments{
\item{ds}{dataset as a data.frame object}

\item{sf}{sampling frame as a data.frame object}

\item{dssite}{name as a string of the field in the dataset where the site is stored}

\item{sfsite}{name as a string of the field in the sampling frame where the site is stored}

\item{survcons}{name as a string of the field in the dataset where the survey consent is stored}

\item{sftarget}{name as a string of the field where the target number of survey is stored in the sampling frame}

\item{sfnbpts}{name as a string of the field where the number of points generated is stored in the sampling frame}

\item{formul}{formulas as a list of string used to compute the final number of eligible surveys and the variance from the target (C('formula1','formula2')).
the values/fields available are: done and the ones generated according the survey consent values (one per value)}

\item{colorder}{column names as a list of string to order the colums in the result (C('col1','col2',...)).
the columns available are: site, done, final, variance and the ones generated according the survey consent values (one per value)}
