## High Frequency Data Quality Checks

This package brings a series of convenience functions to monitor data quality when running a survey with kobotoolbox (or any `xlsform` compatible platform). 

It is an adaptation in R of the [Stata package for running high-frequency checks on research data at Innovations for Poverty Action](https://github.com/PovertyAction/high-frequency-checks)


The package vignette offers a practical [data quality monitoring template](articles/HFC.html)

The packages includes the following check:

### Enumerator Productivity
 * Number of surveys per day by enumerator
 * Build tracking sheet
 * Identify  enumerators with very low or high productivity
 * Identify  enumerators who pick up less than a certain number answers per specific questions
 * Identify enumerators who made a survey below a certain number of minutes
 * Assess number of survey per day of data collection
 * Assess number of survey per day of data collection per consent status
 * Percentage of survey per consent status by enumerator
 * Average interview duration by enumerator
 

### Checking for logical errors in data
 * Duplicates in unique ID
 * Interviews that do not end on the same day as they started
 * Interviews which end before they start
 * Interviews made before the first day of data collection 
 * Interviews made in the future
 * Check for potential errors on the dates are not marked for deletion which can lead to weird duration

### Checks on the surveys content
 * Number of distinct values per questions
 * Number of other distinct values (for the questions with a possibility of other)

### Checking Spatial Data

 * check that the recorded site is the actual one
 * check that the survey is done within a certain buffer meter buffer from a sample point
