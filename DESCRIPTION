Description: This package groups the functions used to perform the 
    High Frequency checks during the data collection.
    These are usual functions to be ran periodically during the 
    data collection process to check for possible errors and provide
    meaningful inputs to the enumerators.
    All these functions do not have to be ran at the same period of 
    time. They are provided there to help you to build a report.
